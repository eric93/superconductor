			<p>I’ll be in Newport News, Virginia this April 4th to give a talk at my old school, Christopher Newport University.</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to it! The chaos of the past year and a 
half didn’t leave me with much time or energy for travel or events, so 
it’ll be fun to get out and meet people again. I’m also looking forward 
to seeing the campus, which I hear has changed substantially since I 
left.</p>
<p>The talk isn’t limited to CNU students, so if you live nearby, you’re
 welcome to come!&nbsp;Admission is free, but since space is limited, 
you’ll need to reserve tickets&nbsp;<a href="http://cnu.edu/pcs/xkcd/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Almost four years ago, I posted <a href="http://xkcd.com/426/">a comic</a> laying out the <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page">Geohashing algorithm</a>.
 The algorithm generated a set of random latitudes and longitudes each 
day, spread out across the globe so there was generally always one 
within a few dozen miles of every location. I figured they could be used
 for hiking destinations, sightseeing, meetups, or whatever else people 
came up with.</p>
<p>I wanted to make an algorithm that anyone could implement, which 
didn’t rely on a central authority or ongoing support from any one 
maintainer. I also wanted to make it impossible to know the locations 
more than a day or so in advance, so that if geohashing became popular 
in an area, no one could publish a list of future locations that woud 
give property owners, park rangers, or local police time to prepare. So 
each day’s coordinates are randomized using the most recent Dow Jones 
opening price, which isn’t known until the morning of that day—or, in 
the case of weekends, a day or two in advance, which helps with planning
 larger weekend trips.</p>
<p>In the days after I posted the comic, there was a flurry of 
geohashing activity, which quieted down as the initial novelty wore off.
 But it didn’t die, and for the past several years there’s been a small 
but vibrant community building around the <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page">Geohashing Wiki</a>.
 There are numerous daily expeditions, and they’ve taken some beautiful 
pictures and come up with a lot of neat tools, games, and <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Achievements">achievements</a>.</p>
<p>One of the many things they did was use a tweaked version of the algorithm to come up with a <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Globalhash">globalhash</a>,
 a single coordinate for the day somewhere on the planet (biased toward 
the areas near the poles). They’re usually over the ocean, but a few of 
the land ones have been reached.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/2012-02-26_global">Yesterday’s globalhash</a> fell less than a kilometer from the South Pole. User <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/User:Cjk">Carl-Johan</a>&nbsp;got in touch with the Scott-Amundsen research station, and later that day, the hash was <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/2012-02-26_global">reached</a>
 by Katie Hess,&nbsp;Dale Mole, and Joselyn Fenstermacher of the US, 
Robert Schwarz of Germany, and&nbsp;Sven Lidström of Sweden.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/2012-02-26_global"><img class="alignnone" title="Holy crap." src="xkcd_blag_files/south_pole_globalhash_450.jpg" alt="" height="338" width="450"></a></p>
<p>Wow. Just wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><em>If you want to look up today’s geohash for your location, you can use <a href="http://carabiner.peeron.com/xkcd/map/map.html">this online tool</a>, or one of the others listed on the&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Geo_Hashing:Coordinate_calculators">Coordinate Calculators</a> page.</em></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In xkcd.com/1010 (I have a hard time not reading that as “ten”) I 
said that before 2004, there weren’t really any photos or videos of 
tsunamis. This isn’t quite true—there were a handful of photos and at 
least one video.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I was had an irrationally powerful fear of tsunamis
 (Etymology-Man would suggest “cymophobia”). I swam in the ocean a lot 
when I was very young, so waves were a big part of my world. &nbsp;I 
would fret about tsunamis whenever I was near the coast, and to this day
 I have occasional nightmares about a wave coming out of nowhere and 
sweeping me away.</p>
<p>Looking back, part of what made tsunamis frightening was was that I 
didn’t know what they looked like, and my imagination ran wild filling 
in the gaps.&nbsp;I read what I could find about them. In particular, I 
remember being just old enough to work my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/1001-Questions-Answered-About-Earthquakes/dp/0486236463">this book</a>,
 and carrying it&nbsp;around with me so I could read the tsunami section
 over and over. It included a grainy photo of a ship in a Japanese 
harbor plowing through an unimpressive-looking line of breakers. I think
 that’s also where I found a photo of some people running away from 
something (it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tsunami_large.jpg">this photo</a>, but the reproduction in my book was too grainy to see what they were running from).</p>
<p>Years later, after the rise of the web, I realized maybe I could now 
find a video of a tsunami, and finally see the thing that had so 
captivated me as a child. But my searches for videos didn’t turn up much
 of anything.</p>
<p>Then the 2004 tsunami happened. Shortly after, as YouTube and its 
various clones proliferated, there was more horrifying footage available
 than I could handle.</p>
<p>A year or two ago, I read an article somewhere (I have tried to find 
it again with no luck) which mentioned that before 2004, there hadn’t 
been much in the way of photographic or video records of tsunamis, and 
that this had contributed to a lack of understanding of their form. My 
childhood impression seemingly confirmed, I worked this into a comic.</p>
<p>It turns out I was mistaken. There are several photographs, some of which can be seen&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/violent-hawaii/deadly-tsunamis/1862/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.pdc.org/iweb/tsunami_history.jsp">here</a>, and <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EEKLD0uycnQ/Tj1mn1rH2GI/AAAAAAAAAX4/Fqpt-zGS0LE/s1600/1946tsunami.jpg">here</a>. There’s also&nbsp;a video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09xQ8n6GiTY">here</a>&nbsp;(sent in by <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/author/pplait/">Phil Plait</a>).</p>
<p>I think what confused me as a child was that none of the photos 
showed the wave I expected—just debris, and occasionally some visible 
water.&nbsp;Now that I’ve seen horrifying videos like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-t5qe_VSEA">this</a>, I’ve gone back to some of those old photos and realized that they <em>did</em> show a tsunami. It was just so unlike what I was expecting that I didn’t recognize it.</p>
<p>So thank you to everyone who sent in information. It’s really 
fascinating stuff. Oh, and anyone interested in the history of tsunamis 
might want to check out a <a href="http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search">Google Books advanced search</a> for material published before 1850 containing phrases like <strong>earthquake wave</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>earthquake tide</strong>,&nbsp;or <strong>earthquake water feet</strong>.
 There are some gripping historical accounts buried there, along with 
some really interesting speculation by 19th-century scientists about the
 mechanisms behind earthquakes and their associated waves (the consensus
 seemed to be hot gas moving between&nbsp;subterranean&nbsp;chambers).</p>

			<p>xkcd.com is registered with GoDaddy. This is an artifact of my 
registering my own domains nearly ten years ago, back when I was 
completely new to making websites.</p>
<p>I’ve always been a little uneasy about having all my domains with 
them, since they’ve got a long history of screwing over domain owners, 
but never got around to doing anything about it. A little while back, as
 the SOPA thing blew up, I poked davean, the xkcd sysadmin, about 
whether it was time to make switching to someone more geek-friendly a 
priority.</p>
<p>He’s also wanted to switch away from GoDaddy for years (and recently 
met with the reddit folks to chat about SOPA stuff). He’s periodically 
done surveys of the alternatives, but—strange as it sounds—he’s actually
 had trouble finding an affordable registrar with the feature set we 
needed. In particular, he said he had trouble finding any that support 
IPv6 Glue and DNSSEC via a control system that doesn’t rely on filing 
and waiting on support tickets, which he says (and I quote) “freaks me 
out” as a means of handling registrar stuff (he’s very much an 
xkcd.com/705 style of administrator). The ones that did offer those 
features tended to be a little too high-priced for our large number of 
domains.</p>
<p>We’ve had a number of alternatives recommended in the past week or 
two, but none have quite satisfied davean’s criteria. If you know of any
 registrars that might work for us, you can email us at contact@xkcd.com
 and he’ll take a look.</p>
<p>We’re being cautious about how we handle this switch, since GoDaddy 
has seemingly been obstructing transfers in a way that can leave the 
sites trapped in limbo. But don’t worry—it’s in the works!</p>

			<p>I had a huge amount of fun putting the <a href="http://xkcd.com/980/">money chart</a>
 together. It was the first time in a long time that my life’s been 
stable enough that I’ve been able to really disappear into a project—I’d
 almost forgotten how enjoyable it can be.</p>
<p>I’ve corrected a bunch of typos and other minor errors, most of which
 crept into the project during the final 36-hour no-sleep marathon to 
integrate all the pieces together. (Those corrections, plus a few more 
that will be added over the next few days, will all be integrated into 
the printed <a href="http://store.xkcd.com/xkcd/#MoneyPoster" title="poster"></a> version).</p>
<p>Now it’s time for me to to spend some time relaxing with family, and 
trying to break the habit—trained into me by the research I did for the 
chart—of thinking of everything in economic terms.  To those of you in 
the US (GDP: $15.18 trillion<sup><a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2011/pdf/gdp3q11_2nd.pdf">[1]</a></sup>, total net worth: $58.73 trillion<sup><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1r-5.pdf">[2]</a></sup>), have a happy Thanksgiving!</p>

			<p>As many people have pointed out, my <a href="http://xkcd.com/723/">comic</a> about tweets outrunning seismic waves seems to have been widely verified in yesterday’s earthquake:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/earthquake-twitter-users-learned-tremors-226481">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/earthquake-twitter-users-learned-tremors-226481</a></p>
<p>It’s always nice to see real-life confirmation of your calculations! 
The quake started in Virginia at 13:51:04 EST, where most of my family 
lives. &nbsp;Texts from my brother in Charlottesville (25 miles from the
 epicenter) were slowed down by the spike in cell traffic, but I got an 
IRC message from my brother in Newport News, VA at 13:52:09. Based on <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/08/23/virginia-earthquake-waves-ripple-across-the-us/">USArray/EarthScope detector readings posted at Bad Astronomy</a>,
 his message overtook the seismic waves outside&nbsp;Philadelphia, and 
reached New England over a minute before the quake was felt there.</p>
<p>I once heard a story (originally told by Kevin Young) about Gerson 
Goldhaber, who was a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. He was
 talking on the phone with another physicist at SLAC near Stanford 
University near the end of the day on Tuesday, October 17, 1989. The 
SLAC physicist suddenly interrupted with, “Gerson, I have to go! There’s
 a very big earthquake happening!” and then hung up. So Gerson stepped 
out into a group of people in the hall, made a big show of yawning and 
checking his watch, then said, “Aren’t we about due for an earthquake?” 
Before anyone could respond, the Loma Prieta earthquake reached 
Berkeley, and he became a legend.</p>
<p>My best friend from college is from Mineral, VA, a town of a few 
hundred people and one stoplight, which was at the epicenter of 
yesterday’s quake. A few years ago, he moved to Sendai, Japan, where he 
got an apartment just a few miles from the coast. Fortunately, he 
survived the March earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown. Last I 
heard from him, he was moving back home. He really can’t catch a 
break.&nbsp;Fortunately, it sounds like there’s not too much damage. 
(Though from what I remember of Mineral, I can’t help but wonder—if the 
quake <em>did</em> cause damage, how would you tell?)</p>

			<p>I’m at a family reunion, where a YouTube-watching party inspired <a href="http://xkcd.com/920/">today’s comic</a>.  I woke up to find several emails letting me know, to my dismay, that the comic Doghouse Diaries has already done a <a href="http://www.thedoghousediaries.com/?p=1242">similar strip</a> about the same experience.</p>
<p>I linked to their site last year when I posted my <a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/">color survey results</a>,
 but I confess I hadn’t read through their archives, so I think this was
 just a case of parallel inspiration. Still, I really like their version
 and I’m sorry for the repetition!</p>
<p>Happy 4th of July, and to those of you spending it with family, enjoy
 sitting through your parents watching Double Rainbow for the first 
time!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last fall I posted about a family illness, but didn’t give a lot of details.</p>
<p>In October my fiancée was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer. 
It’s rare for young women to get breast cancer, and she’s otherwise 
healthy and has no family history, so it was a real bolt from the blue.</p>
<p>She’s been in nonstop treatment for the last eight months, which has 
been an emotional and physical ordeal that’s hard to describe. We both 
have all the support we could ask for—including an incredible medical 
team—and we’ve had some really good moments during these months, but 
it’s still a terrifying and isolating experience. Treatment is ongoing, 
and there’s no well-defined end point; things are going to continue to 
be scary and difficult for a while.</p>
<p>I’m usually pretty private about my personal life, but I wanted to 
explain why I’ve missed some midnight comic deadlines and have been 
particularly hard to reach lately. I’ve also spent a lot of these eight 
months immersed in cancer science, and I want to be free to talk (and 
draw comics) about stuff I’m learning without the unexplained subject 
matter leaving everyone worried and guessing.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your patience, kind words, and all the little 
flash games you all sent. And all the best to those of you who are also 
caring for someone with cancer, or who are struggling with cancer 
yourselves.</p>
