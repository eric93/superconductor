<h1>Demonstration</h1>
This test highlights that in a block layout, the intrinsic width of floats is added as a max.  

<p>This test also reveals a rendering bug in Opera: the floats are painted <i>before</i> their parent border.

<p>This test also reveals a bug in WebKit. In the middle set of boxes, a block's content seems to move around one float but not all.
